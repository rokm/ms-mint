Its main function is to sum up intensity values from (usually) pre-defined windows in m/z and scan-time (also called retention time) space. These windows can be provided in from of a peaklist-file or set programmatically. Therefore, a large number of MS-files can be processed in very standardized and reproducible manner. The tool can be used with a browser based graphical user interface (GUI) implemented as interactive dashboard with Plotly-Dash . A second (experimental) GUI is available that runs integrated in a Jupyter Notebook . Alternatively, the ms_mint package can be imported as python library to be integrated in any Python script and processing pipeline to automate MS-file processing. Installation With Anaconda (Miniconda) and PIP conda create -n ms-mint python=3.8 conda activate ms-mint pip install ms-mint Just PIP The program can be installed in a Python 3 (>= 3.7) environment using pip : pip install ms-mint From source in Anaconda environment (recommended for Windows) Here we use conda from the miniconda (or alternatively anaconda ) package to install dependencies in a virtual environment. git clone https://github.com/soerendip/ms-mint cd ms-mint conda create -n ms-mint python=3.8 conda activate ms-mint pip setup.py install # for regular install pip install -e . # for development Starting the browser based GUI The browser based GUI can then be started with conda activate ms-mint # if you run MINT in an Anaconda environment Mint.py Then navigate to the following ULR with your browser: http://localhost:9999/ . The graphical user interface is explained in more detail here Peaklists A peaklist is the protocol that captures how data is going to be extracted from the individual MS-files. It is provided as csv-file and essentially contains the definitions of peaks to be extracted. A single peak is defined by five properties that need to be present as headers in the csv-file which will be explained in the following: peak_label : A unique identifier such as the biomarker name or ID. Even if multiple peaklist files are used, the label have to be unique across all the files. mz_mean : The target mass (m/z-value) in [Da]. mz_width : The width of the peak in the m/z-dimension in units of ppm. The window will be mz_mean +/- (mz_width * mz_mean * 1e-6). Usually, a values between 5 and 10 are used. rt_min : The start of the retention time for each peak in [min]. rt_max : The end of the retention time for each peak in [min]. intensity_threshold : A threshold that is applied to filter noise for each window individually. Can be set to 0 or any positive value. Example file peaklist.csv: peak_label,mz_mean,mz_width,rt_min,rt_max,intensity_threshold Biomarker-A,151.0605,10,4.65,5.2,0 Biomarker-B,151.02585,10,4.18,4.53,0","title":"Home"},{"location":"#mint-documentation","text":"MINT (Metabolomics Integrator) is an app for processing mzML and mzXML mass-spectrometry (MS) files in MS1 mode.
